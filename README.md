# MV map ship image generator
## Usage

Drag and drop your mod folder into `map-ship-generator.py`.

If you already have a ship image, you can add it into map_ship_res/ to generate it with shadow and blue/red halo. The name must match the ship sprite name in the folder with the added prefix "map_icon_".

In img/map/ folder, you can find the generated images. This is the same path it should be placed in inside the mod file.

In data/ folder, you will find the generated data file to append the map icons to your ships.
